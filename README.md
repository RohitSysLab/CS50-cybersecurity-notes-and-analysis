# CS50 Cybersecurity – Notes and Analysis

This repository documents my structured learning journey through CS50 Cybersecurity.

The goal is not to provide solutions, but to:
- Break down core security concepts
- Build strong mental models
- Reflect on weaknesses and confusion
- Connect theory to real-world systems

Each section includes:
- Concept notes
- Personal reflections
- Deeper analysis
- Questions for further exploration

This repository does NOT contain assignment solutions.
