# Introduction – CS50 Cybersecurity

## 1. Core Idea
In Cybersecurity detection of attack is also equally important as prevention of attack

## 2. Key Insights from the Lecture

- in modern times AI helps in detecting attack patterns
- Detection should be treated as equally important as prevention.
- Security is also psychological — attackers may give up if effort exceeds reward.

## 3. Mental Model

Skills in Security is not about building an unbreakable wall or being the most technical guy in the room.
It is about raising the cost of attack high enough that the attacker loses interest.In other words its a game of psychology too

## 4. Why Detection Matters

If prevention fails, detection allows faster response and limits damage.
This shifts cybersecurity from "perfect defense" to "recovery."

## 5. Questions I Have

- How exactly does AI detect attack patterns?
- What are real examples where attackers gave up?
- How do companies balance prevention vs detection budgets?

- ## 6. Deeper Reflection

If cybersecurity is a mix of both technology and psychology, then absolute security may be impossible.so
Instead, the goal becomes risk management.

This means:
- Understanding attacker's motivation
- Reducing the amount of value/data an attacker can extract
- Increasing detection speed
- Designing systems assuming that breaches will happen
